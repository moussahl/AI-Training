Build a number guessing game where there is a target number the user must find it, when the user enter a number, you must indicate if the desired one is less or more than the input, the user has 10 attempts, if he did not find the number within those attempts, he loses, if he finds it he wins, you should put that in a function. Note: you can use the library random to generate the target number or you can simply put it manually in your code.
